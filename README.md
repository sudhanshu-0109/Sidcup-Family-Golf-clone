# Frontend Website Clone – Sidcup Family Golf

# live link - https://sidcupfamilygolfclone09.netlify.app/

## Project Overview

This project is a **frontend clone of the Sidcup Family Golf website**, recreated using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a strong focus on **animations, interactions, and smooth user experience**.

The purpose of this project was to **study and replicate a real-world, animation-heavy website**, understand modern UI/UX patterns, and implement them from scratch using **frontend fundamentals and GSAP**.

This is a **non-commercial, educational project** intended to demonstrate frontend development skills.

---

## Project Goals

- Recreate a **production-level modern UI**
- Implement **advanced animations and motion effects**
- Practice clean and maintainable frontend architecture
- Gain hands-on experience with **GSAP and ScrollTrigger**
- Improve attention to detail in UI/UX behavior

---

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, transforms, transitions, and animations  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – DOM manipulation and interaction logic  
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** – Scroll-based and timeline animations  

> No frontend frameworks or UI libraries were used.

## Key Features

### Layout & Visual Design
- Full-screen hero section with **background video**
- Fixed navigation bar with scroll-based animation
- Large typography with layered stroke effects
- Multi-section layout closely matching the original site

### Animations & Interactions
- Scroll-triggered animations using **GSAP ScrollTrigger**
- Infinite marquee text animation
- Animated cards with hover overlays
- Flat tilted image scroller animation
- Custom animated cursor with blur trail
- Hover-based micro-interactions across the UI

### Performance Considerations
- Transform-based animations (`translate`, `scale`, `rotate`)
- Optimized animation timing and easing
- Smooth cursor animation using `requestAnimationFrame`
- Avoided layout-thrashing properties

---

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Strong understanding of **frontend fundamentals**
- Ability to **reverse-engineer real-world websites**
- Practical experience with **GSAP animation workflows**
- Clean separation of structure, style, and behavior
- Focus on smooth, performant user experiences

---

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained:

- Hands-on experience building **animation-driven interfaces**
- Deeper understanding of **scroll-based UI interactions**
- Confidence using **GSAP timelines and ScrollTrigger**
- Improved ability to translate visual design into code
